Step 1: Include the required header files.

Step 2: Declare a class library:
Data members: variable_1, variable_ 2,and Resulting Variable
Member Function: i. void getdata (); Take input From User.
ii. void addition (); Perform addition Operation.
iii. void subtraction ();Perform Subtraction Operation.
iv. Void Multiplication();To perform Multiplication
v. Void Division()

Step 3: Write main () function.

Step 4: In main create menu-
i. Addition.

ii. Subtraction.
iii.Multiplication.
iv.Division
v. Exit

Step 5: Read two values from user by using getdata () function.

Step 6: If user choice = 1, then go to Step 7

Step 7: Call addition () function to Perform addition Operation. 

Step 8: If userchoice = 2, then go to Step 9

Step 9: call subtraction () function to Perform Subtraction Operation. 

Step 10: If user choice = 3, then go to Step 11

Step 11: call multiplication () function to perform Multiplication Operation. 

Step 12: If userchoice = 4, then go to step 14.

Step 13: call division () function to Perform Division Operation. 

Step 14: If user choice is 5, then terminate the program.

Step 15: Stop.
