iii void area (float, int, int); Insert area of triangle

Step 3: Write main () function and create the object of class area.

i. Area of Sphere
ii. Area of rectangle
iii. Area of triangle
iv. Exit

Step 4: Choice=1 then go to the Step 5.

Step 5: The function area () to find area of Sphere with one integer argument by using formula
4*Ï€*r*r .

Step 6: Choice=2 then go to the step 7

Step 7: The function area () to find area of Sphere with two integer argument by using
formula l*b.

Step 8: Choice=3 then go to the step 9

Step 9: The function area () to find area of Sphere with three integer argument by using
formula
Step 10: Choice=4 then terminate the Program
Step 11: Stop
